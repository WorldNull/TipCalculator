## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to design the app
2. I don't have any experience with the model-view-controller pattern, so the structure of my code might not be incorrect
3. I also threw away some ideas I thought were impractical
4. Some of the features i thought were easy to code turned out to be difficult, because I haven't done much programming in Swift
